# Welcome to ShoppingApp!

Hi! I created the application called **ShoppinApp** for the project of my course which is **Cross Platform App Development**. 
If you want to learn about http GET, DELETE, POST and PUT functions, you can take a look at the project. 
If you are looking for simple UI examples, this is a project that can satisfy your wishes. After downloading the application you can run it using VSCode. 
Expo-Cli is used in the application. 
If you type **expo start** on the terminal screen, the application will run.
My advice is to run it on **iOS** or **Android** devices also it's run on web.
